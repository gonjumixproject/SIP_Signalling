# What is SIP

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling, presence and instant messaging protocol developed to set up, modify, and tear down multimedia sessions, request and deliver presence and instant messages over the Internet.


SIP was developed by the IETF as part of the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture, and was designed to dovetail with other Internet protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Transmission Layer Security (TLS), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Internet Protocol (IP), Domain Name System (DNS), and others. 


As the name implies,the protocol allows two end points to establish media sessions with each other. 

The main signaling functions of the protocol are as follows: 

• Location of an end point;
• Contacting an end point to determine willingness to establish a session; 
• Exchange of media information to allow session to be established; 
• Modification of existing media sessions;
• Tear-down of existing media sessions.

SIP is a client-server protocol of equipotent peers.
